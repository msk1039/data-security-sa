15. Implement HIPAA compliance requirements for securing healthcare data in a cloud environment, focusing on access control and audit trails for patient records.
16. Apply PCI DSS requirements (e.g., network segmentation, encryption) to a financial transaction platform handling cardholder data, focusing on Requirement 3 (Protect Stored Data).
17. Apply AI techniques (e.g., machine learning models) to automatically detect anomalies in log data that suggest a security breach, giving an example of an unusual user login location.
18. Apply an incident response strategy to contain and eradicate a successful phishing attack that compromised several employee credentials, including password resets and system checks.
19. Apply recovery planning best practices for containerized applications (e.g., Kubernetes) after a cluster failure, focusing on restoring configuration and persistent volumes.
20. Implement role−based access control (RBAC) policies in analytics pipelines to ensure data scientists only access anonymized or aggregated data.
21. Differentiate and analyze the complexities and costs associated with multi−cloud versus hybrid cloud recovery strategies, considering vendor lock-in and interoperability.
22. Analyze the business and security benefits derived from metadata tagging for auditing, reporting, and automated policy enforcement, specifically in data residency compliance.
23. Compare and contrast the key compliance requirements and scope differences between PCI DSS (cardholder data) and HIPAA (health information).
24. Assess the effectiveness and responsibilities of data stewardship roles in maintaining governance across distributed databases and resolving data quality disputes.
25. Evaluate the best backup and retention policies for ETL−based data pipelines that process large volumes of transient data, focusing on checkpointing and source data availability.
26. Analyze the challenges in securing complex AI/ML data pipelines for analytics, focusing on data poisoning and model integrity risks.
27. Evaluate the role of AI and automation in compliance monitoring and reporting, focusing on efficiency versus false positives and accountability.
28. Critique an enterprise recovery plan after a major ransomware attack, identifying vulnerabilities in the cyber recovery vault strategy (e.g., untested recovery images).
29. Evaluate the effectiveness of automated recovery and failover mechanisms in maintaining the Resilience of cloud−native applications during an infrastructure outage.
30. Design a data retention policy spanning five years for an enterprise, ensuring it meets both business needs and legal requirements for financial auditing.
31. Design a monitoring and logging workflow for multi−tiered applications, specifying where metrics should be collected for security analysis and performance tuning.
32. Design a cyber recovery fire drill for a multinational organization, including specific roles,timelines, and verification steps to restore core business services.
33. Formulate a disaster recovery strategy for geographically distributed NoSQL databases (e.g.,Cassandra), focusing on eventual consistency during a regional failure.
34. Propose a governance framework specifically for multi−tenant SaaS applications, ensuring strict data segregation and access control between customer environments.
