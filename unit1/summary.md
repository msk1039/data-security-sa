# Unit 1 – Summary

Short list of topics, simple meanings, and important full forms.

## Main Topics & Simple Definitions

- **Data Lifecycle Management (DLM):** Way of **handling data from creation to secure deletion**, with clear rules at every stage.
- **Data Life Cycle Stages:** Steps of data – **create, store, use, share, archive, destroy**.
- **Data Archival:** **Moving old, rarely used data** to cheap, long‑term storage (for records and law), usually read‑only.
- **DLM Goals:** **Save storage cost, follow laws, protect data, and support quick recovery**.
- **DLM Challenges:** Problems like **data scattered in many systems, weak tagging, old tools, and changing laws**.
- **Secure Data Destruction:** **Properly erasing or destroying data/media** so nothing can be recovered later.
- **Data Growth Impact:** More data means **more cost, slower backups/restores, and slower systems** if not managed.
- **No DLM Consequences:** **Fines, high storage bills, more breach risk, and slow audits**.
- **User Access vs Tiering:** Users want **fast access**, but DLM wants **cheap storage** for old data, so we balance both.
- **Data Sprawl:** Data is **spread everywhere** (servers, laptops, cloud, USB), so hard to control and secure.
- **Hospital Patient Record Lifecycle:** Patient data is **created, stored securely, backed up, archived, then deleted** as per law.
- **Cloud Retention & Object Lock:** Use **cloud rules and object lock/legal hold** so data **cannot be deleted too early**.
- **Archival Benefits:** Archiving **reduces primary storage size**, **cuts cost**, and **speeds up systems**.
- **Streaming Service DLM:** Popular content on **fast storage**, old shows on **cheap storage**; user data handled and deleted as per rules.
- **Policy‑Based Movement:** Use **access logs and age** to move data automatically between **hot, warm, cold** tiers.
- **Layered Data Protection System:** **Production → backup → dedupe → encryption → storage → management** layers.
- **Unmanaged vs Managed Data (TCO):** No DLM = **higher cost and risk**; DLM = **controlled growth, lower cost**.
- **Storage vs Archival Stage:** **Storage = active, fast, costly**; **archival = slow, cheap, long‑term**.
- **DLM Metrics:** Track **storage by tier, backup time, correct retention, and destruction logs**.
- **Impact of Poor Destruction:** Old data not erased can **leak, cause fines, and damage reputation**.
- **Data Recovery Without DLM:** Hard to know **where data is**, so recovery is **slow and uncertain**.
- **DLM in Government:** Needed to **handle huge data and many laws** in different regions.
- **DLM in Finance/Healthcare:** Strict rules; DLM **prevents penalties and loss of trust**.
- **DLM for E‑commerce:** Fast storage for **new orders**, archives for **old sales**, clear retention and anonymization.
- **Retention Policies (Legal View):** Laws say **how long to keep data**; wrong retention can cause **penalties**.
- **WORM / Immutable Backups:** Storage where data **cannot be changed or deleted** until time is over; very good against **ransomware and mistakes**.
- **University DLM Policy:** Classify student data, set **role‑based access, retention, and deletion/anonymization** rules.
- **Checklist for Final Archival/Destruction:** **Confirm retention is over → archive needed data → securely destroy rest → record proof**.
- **Social Media Content Lifecycle:** User content is **created, moderated, shown, maybe archived, then removed** when user deletes or time ends.
- **DLM Training for Staff:** Simple training so staff **know how to handle, share, and report issues about data**.

## Important Terms & Full Forms

- **DLM – Data Lifecycle Management:** Managing data from **creation to destruction** with rules.
- **TCO – Total Cost of Ownership:** **Total long‑term cost** of owning and managing a system/data.
- **WORM – Write Once Read Many:** Data can be **written once, then only read**, not changed or deleted.
- **GDPR – General Data Protection Regulation:** **EU data privacy law** that controls how personal data is handled.
- **EMR / EHR – Electronic Medical/Health Record:** **Digital system** for storing patient medical records.
