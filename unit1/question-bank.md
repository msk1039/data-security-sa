1. Summarize Data Life Cycle Management (DLM) and explain its overarching purpose in ensuring governance and compliance throughout the data's existence.
2. List and describe the key high-level stages that constitute the comprehensive data life cycle, from creation to final disposition.
3. State the meaning of data archival in the context of DLM, and differentiate it from routine data storage by explaining its specific retention and access requirements.
4. Identify and state the main goals of implementing a formal DLM strategy, focusing on cost optimization, risk mitigation, and regulatory adherence.
5. Name and briefly explain any three common challenges encountered during the implementation of DLM, such as data silos or policy enforcement.
6. Explain in detail why secure data destruction is not merely disposal but a critical and necessary stage in DLM to prevent data leakage and legal liabilities.
7. Describe how the exponential increase in data volume impacts the complexity and tooling required for effective lifecycle management, particularly in classification and migration.
8. Illustrate the major business and operational consequences of an organization failing to implement a structured DLM framework, focusing on non-compliance penalties and inefficient storage costs.
9. Discuss how evolving user demand for immediate access influences and potentially conflicts with optimized DLM strategies for cost-effective storage tiering.
10. Explain the concept of “ubiquity of data locations” (data sprawl) in simple terms and its implication for centralized data governance and security controls.
11. Apply core DLM principles to design an initial lifecycle for sensitive hospital patient record systems,specifying creation, secure storage, and regulatory-compliant archival stages.
12. Demonstrate a strategy to ensure compliance with long−term data retention policies specifically within dynamic, elastic cloud storage systems (e.g., using object lock or legal holds).
13. Show and quantify how the process of data archival effectively reduces primary storage costs and improves the performance and response time of active systems.
14. Suggest and justify a suitable DLM strategy for a media streaming service where content popularity dictates its storage tier, prioritizing fast access for popular media and cost efficiency for older content.
15. Demonstrate how data usage logs and access patterns can be leveraged to improve the efficiency and automation of DLM policies, specifically for policy-based data movement.
16. Draw and explain the layered architecture of a modern data protection system integrating backup, deduplication, and encryption technologies to ensure data security and integrity across the lifecycle.
17. Compare and contrast the risks and costs associated with unmanaged data versus managed data under a formal DLM framework, focusing on the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).
18. Differentiate precisely between the storage stage and the archival stage of the data lifecycle based on purpose, security requirements, retrieval speed, and cost model.
19. Identify and examine the key metrics and components that must be continuously monitored to ensure the health and compliance of DLM operations, such as policy adherence rates and destruction verification logs.
20. Analyze the comprehensive impact of poor data destruction practices on an organization's legal standing,reputation, and compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR).
21. Examine the specific challenges related to data recovery and integrity when an organization lacks a standardized DLM process, leading to uncertain data location and unverified deletion.
22. Evaluate the benefits and inherent complexities of implementing DLM in large, highly regulated government organizations, considering the interplay of multiple jurisdictions.
23. Justify the critical need for robust DLM policies, focusing on regulatory requirements in either the finance or healthcare sector, to prevent financial penalties and loss of public trust.
24. Critique a sample DLM strategy designed for an e−commerce platform, focusing on its ability to manage both high-traffic customer transaction data and low-access historical sales records.
25. Assess the importance of retention policies from a purely legal and jurisdictional perspective, citing potential penalties for non-compliance with e-discovery and audit mandates.
26. Rate the effectiveness of a specific DLM best practice (e.g., using WORM storage or Immutable Backups) in mitigating data integrity risks from accidental or malicious deletion.
27. Design a comprehensive DLM policy document for a university database containing student academic and personal records, including classification, access, retention, and deletion criteria.
28. Create a detailed checklist of procedures and verifications required for the final archival and secure destruction of high-risk data, ensuring irrecoverability and certification.
29. Develop a flowchart detailing the complete data lifecycle for user-generated content on a social media platform, incorporating stages for moderation, active use, and eventual deletion.
30. Formulate detailed DLM training guidelines for non-technical staff to ensure company-wide adherence todata policies regarding data handling, sharing, and reporting of incidents.
